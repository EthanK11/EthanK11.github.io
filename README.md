# The Distribution of Undergradute Student Enrollment At Lehigh in 2019
![image](https://github.com/EthanK11/EthanK11.github.io/blob/master/student%20enrollment.png?raw=true)

Using Lehigh University's Fall Profile, I collected data concerning undergraduate student enrollment. I created an infographic displaying the distribution of ungraduate student enrollment in each of the colleges, provided by Lehigh's Office of Institutional Research & Strategic Analytics. I selected a charcoal background color, used a grid to format an aerial photo of campus, wrote a title, and created a mulitcolor pie chart to show the percentage of students enrolled in each college.

# A Cowboys Fan's Statistical Comparison of Dak Prescott and Carson Wentz

The infographic above displays the statistics of Cowboys and Eagles Quarterbacks Dak Prescott and Carson Wentz from 2016 to currently Week 2 of the 2020 NFL season. I collected the data from reliable, complete NFL data sets and compiled it into a side by side comparison to support my unbiased argument that Dak Prescott was the more talented quarterback out of the 2016 NFL draft. Confounding variables that would influence these statistics include: offensive line, coaching staff, wide receiver depth, and overall the talent of the team surrounding each player. From 2016 to 2019, Prescott played under Jason Garrett who is widely considered worse than Super Bowl-winning coach, Doug Pederson. As mentioned, Wentz was surrounded by a high caliber team but became injured and did not take his team through the playoffs to beat the Patriots in the Super bowl. Therefore, based on the varying advantages and disadvantages of each team, I have acknowledged these external factors and focused solely on their individual statistics.

This chart shows  the population growth from 1970 to 2020 of the world's three most populated countries, which are China, India, and the United States, in order of population. It shows that the US was fairly constant in its growth, as the chart shows a fairly horizontal line, while China and India appear to be growing more rapidly and are closer in population.

The data was collected from Lehigh University's 2019 Fall Profile and indicates that Lehigh has very strong arts & science students, and strong engineering and business programs.
