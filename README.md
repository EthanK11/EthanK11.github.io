Using Lehigh University's Fall Profile, I collected data concerning undergraduate student enrollment. I created an infographic displaying the distribution of ungraduate student enrollment in each of the colleges, provided by Lehigh's Office of Institutional Research & Strategic Analytics. I selected a charcoal background color, used a grid to format an aerial photo of campus, wrote a title, and created a mulitcolor pie chart to show the percentage of students enrolled in each college.
