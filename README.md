**About Me**


My name is Ethan Kennedy, I'm 18 and a first-year student at Lehigh. I'm from Bethlehem, PA and I enjoy exercising, reading, writing, listening to music, and having fun. I love sports, mostly football and basketball. I am planning to study Business and Psychology which will help me with a Marketing position in the future. This page is for all of my work for our Data Journalism seminar. I decided to take this class because I have had some experiences with Journalism courses that were very interesting and since I also took Statistics, I wanted to learn how the two subjects can be used together as tools for writing.

**The Distribution of Undergradute Student Enrollment At Lehigh in 2019**
![image](https://github.com/EthanK11/EthanK11.github.io/blob/master/student%20enrollment.png?raw=true)

Using Lehigh University's Fall Profile, I collected data concerning undergraduate student enrollment. I created an infographic displaying the distribution of ungraduate student enrollment in each of the colleges, provided by Lehigh's Office of Institutional Research & Strategic Analytics. To break down the data further, across the six colleges in 2019 there were 5,178 total undergraduate students - 2,779 male and 2,399 female students.

**A Statistical Comparison of Dak Prescott and Carson Wentz**
![image](https://github.com/EthanK11/EthanK11.github.io/blob/master/stat%20comparison%20dak%20vs%20wentz.png?raw=true)


The infographic above displays the statistics of Cowboys and Eagles Quarterbacks Dak Prescott and Carson Wentz from 2016 to currently Week 2 of the 2020 NFL season. The data was collected from reliable, complete NFL data sets and compiled into a side by side comparison to support my unbiased argument that Dak Prescott was the more talented quarterback out of the 2016 NFL draft. Confounding variables that would influence these statistics include: offensive line, coaching staff, wide receiver depth, and overall the talent of the team surrounding each player. From 2016 to 2019, Prescott played under Jason Garrett who is widely considered worse than Super Bowl-winning coach, Doug Pederson. As mentioned, Wentz was surrounded by a high caliber team but became injured and did not take his team through the playoffs to beat the Patriots in the Super bowl. Therefore, based on the varying advantages and disadvantages of each team, I have acknowledged these external factors and focused solely on their individual statistics.

**The Changes in Undergraduate Enrollment of Lehigh's Colleges from 2015-2019**
![image](https://github.com/EthanK11/EthanK11.github.io/blob/master/Undergraduate_Enrollment_of_Lehigh's_Colleges_from_2015-2019_Arts_&_Sciences_Business_Engineering_chartbuilder.png?raw=true)
                                
The above time series line chart shows the changes in undergraduate enrollment of Lehigh's College of Arts & Sciences, College of Business, and College of Engineering from 2015 to 2019. As the chart displays, in 2015 engineering was the college with the highest percentage of the undergraduate student body enrollment, with 35.9%, while Arts & Sciences was lower, at 32.7%. Beginning in 2016 and continuing up to the current academic year, the undergraduate enrollment in the College of Engineering declined while the undergraduate enrollment in the College of Arts & Sciences increased. In 2019, Engineering had 27.1% of undergraduate enrollment while Arts & Sciences had 36.6%. The College of Business has fluctuated but remained mostly the same over the past four years.                             
                                
**The Correlation Between Self-Reported Life Satisfaction and GDP Per Capita in 2017**
![image](https://github.com/EthanK11/EthanK11.github.io/blob/master/Self-reported_Life_Satisfaction_vs_GDP_per_capita,_2017_Life_satisfaction_in_Cantril_Ladder_(World_Happiness_Report_2019)_chartbuilder.png?raw=true)

The scatterplot above displays the relationship between 19 different countries' GDP per capita and average Life Satisfaction based on the Cantril Ladder. As shown by the data points in the plot, the 40,000 to 60,000 range of GDP per capita appears to connect with the highest life satisfaction scores. Since this data is self-reported and is an observational study as opposed to an experiment, it may therefore contain bias which indicates that we can't draw any concrete conclusions from the scatterplot. However, we can make an assumption that a lower GDP per capita will lead to lower life satisfaction since the country is financially disadvantaged and may citizens are most likely unable to live very comfortably. On the other hand, the graph shows that the highest GDP is not associated with the highest level of Life Satisfaction, which could translate to the citizens of a country being overworked. While this is not a definitive consclusion based on the methods of obtaining this data, it seems that 40,000 to 60,000 GDP per capita appears to be the sweet spot for life satisfaction in 2017.  


**Apple's Worldwide Unit Sales of the iPhone from 2007 to 2018**
![image](https://github.com/EthanK11/EthanK11.github.io/blob/master/Apple_Unit_iPhone_Sales_Worldwide_from_2007-2018__iPhone_Sales_(Units_Sold_-_in_millions)_chartbuilder.png?raw=true)


The time series line chart above depicts the immense success of the iPhone, which constitues around 60% of Apple's total revenue. Following Steve Jobs' unveiling of this revolutionary device in 2007, sales hit 1.39 million in the first fiscal year. A year later, sales increased to 8 times that amount and continued to almost double for the subsequent four years, until 2013 where sales hit 150.26 million with the iPhone 5s, the first model with Touch ID and an M7 motion processor. In 2015, iPhone sales jumped to their peak of 231.22 million units sold, with the release of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, which included LTE-Advanced Networks and new 3D Touch Displays. Sales fluctuated over the next three years, with 217.72 million units sold in 2018, which was the last year that Apple reported iPhone unit sales at the end of their fiscal year. Apple claimed that these reports are "not necessarily representative of the strength of our business", indicating that they most likely want to keep this information more private from competitiors and investors.

The above data visualization is a three-part interpretation of results provided by a 2016 survey that was administered to Lehigh University students and aimed to "assess the safety of Lehigh's party atmosphere". As demonstrated by the "preferences" pie chart visualization, the majority of female students responded to the survey with off-campus housing as their choice of party location while the majority of male students preferred on-campus fraternities. The other pie chart visualization, on the right side, illustrates that first year students either have no preference due to a more limited party scene or rarely attend fraternity events. The charts indicate that second year students prefer and attend fraternity parties the most, with third and fourth year students trailing behind. However, off-campus parties appear to have fraternities beat overall. While this may come as a surprise to some, there is an interesting and controversial explanation for this disparity between party location preferences. The National Panhellenic Conference, which regulates the main 26 sorority organizations across the United States, enforces an outdated and sexist rule - sororities are expected to be entirely alcohol-free. This rule places power in the hands of fraternities across America, providing them with the ability to control party environments and distribute alcohol. It can be inferred that this is a concrete factor in why many Lehigh students maintain that their preferred space to have fun is off-campus, rather than the fraternities that dominate the school's party scene, restrict who is invited or allowed, and monopolize the drinking environment on campus. Clearly, this rule has dangerous implications but it appears that many students have already faced this obstacle and chosen to control their own party space and enjoy themselves in a safer atmosphere.
