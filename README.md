# Ethan Kennedy. 



I'm 18 and a first-year student at Lehigh. I enjoy exercising, reading, writing, listening to music, having fun. I love sports, mostly football and basketball. I am planning to study Business and Psychology which will help me in a Marketing position in the future. This page is for all of my work for our Data Journalism seminar.
